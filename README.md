# basic-md-analysis

This project demonstrates the use of Python-based data science tools to explore and analyze molecular dynamics simulation data.

## Project Overview

The data used in this project comes from simulation outputs (LAMMPS, GROMACS, or other tools), representing quantities such as energy, temperature, and pressure over time. The goal is to apply scientific data analysis and visualization techniques to extract insights and demonstrate practical coding skills.

## Objectives

- Parse and clean raw simulation data using **Python**
- Explore trends in energy, temperature, or other observables
- Visualize time series and statistical distributions
- Automate parts of the analysis with custom scripts

## Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter`
